<BODY>
Provides the necessary classes, concrete and abstract, to build the item window in the authoring environment -
the item window allows users to select which sprites (player, enemey, background, etc) will be included in the game.
These classes are: AbstractItemTab, BackgrounImagesTab, EnemySpritesTab, ItemWindow, ItemWindowData, PlayerSpritesTab
AbstractItemTab is the abstract class that BackgroundImagesTab, EnemySpritesTab, and PlayerSpritesTab all extend.
AuthoringMenubarCreator is the essential class that creates each object that appears on the menu, assigns them their own
functionality, and adds them to the window. A string for the menu option, and strings that fill menu options are necessary
so that menu objects can be properly created.
