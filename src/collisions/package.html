This package describes how collisions are handled in the game. The CollisionChecker uses javafx's intersects method to make sure a collision
occurred, and if a collision occurs, reflection is used to determine what behavior the sprites who are colliding should experience, then
the handleCollision from the respective class is called. There are many types of collisions, including DamageCollision(takes health away 
from a colliding sprite), PowerUpCollision(gives a power up to a colliding sprite), ExplosionCollision(causes the sprite in question to
explode), etc. The names are fairly self explanatory.
