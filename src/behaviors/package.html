This package handles the behaviors(movements, attacks, defenses) of anything that is on the screen or 
in the sprite class. The way the class works now, the behaviors of each sprite are triggered with each
update call in the game loop. Thus, each of the classes have a readyToBehavior method that will
return false unless that it is desired that the sprite do that behavior. There are Movement behaviors, with
each of the types of the movements being broken up into different subclasses(movement, moveturn, move vertically, moveExpand, 
moveHorizontally, etc.)
