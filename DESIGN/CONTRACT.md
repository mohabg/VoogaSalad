As a project team, we:
1. Promise to respect each other’s ideas and work.
2. 2. Promise to be active team members and do our fair share of the work as best as we can.
3. 3. Promise to do our work on time or communicate proactively with the team if there will be a delay.
4. 4. Promise to help our fellow team members when they need it.
5. 5. Promise to communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project.

If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may have a meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement. If the person still breaks these promises, we will ask Professor Duvall to help ﬁnd a solution.
